Introduction: Provide the 'Purpose of the Policy' and 'Scope and Applicability'. Policy Objectives: Outline key objectives such as statutory compliance, applicability, and precise definitions. Controls Overview: List each control within the domain, including control identifiers and descriptions. Generate the control overview which is an overview of the control descriptions and generate implementation guidance for that control. Roles and Responsibilities: Specify the roles of internal teams (e.g., Compliance Officer, IT Security Team) and external auditors. Risk Management: Describe how risks will be identified, analyzed, and mitigated. Compliance and Monitoring: Provide details on internal and external monitoring of compliance. Communication and Training: Outline how the policy will be communicated and training will be provided to relevant staff. Document Control and Review: Include information about version control and the review process. References: Provide a list of relevant standards and regulations associated with the domain.
